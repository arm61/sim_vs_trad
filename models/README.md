## /models

The models that are used, alongside the `refnx` package, to analyse the neutron reflectometry by both molecular dynamics simulation and by using the chemically-consistent traditional methods

#### Contents

- `mdsimulation.py`: enables the analysis of the molecular dynamics simulations to return calculated neutron reflectometry profiles
- `mol_vol.py`: enables the traditional, chemically-consistent analysis of neutron reflectometry
