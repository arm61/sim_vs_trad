This folder contains a series of Python scripts that are used in the analysis process.

- `apm.py`: plots the surface pressure isotherm data
- `chisq_total.py`: determines the average chi-squared from other values
- `get_density.py`: determines the number density of different types of atom in the slipids simulation at 30 mN/m
- `sim_lengths.py`: uses the periodictable library to find the scattering lengths of different atom types
